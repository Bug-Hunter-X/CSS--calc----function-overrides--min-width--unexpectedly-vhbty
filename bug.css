The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentages and a `min-width` property:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  min-width: 200px;
}
```

In this case, the `min-width` declaration is overridden by the `calc()` function when the available space is less than 200px. The expected behavior is for the div to maintain a minimum width of 200px, regardless of the percentage calculation.
