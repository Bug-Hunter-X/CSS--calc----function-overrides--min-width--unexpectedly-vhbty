To fix this issue, ensure that the `min-width` declaration is applied after the `width` declaration that uses `calc()`. This ensures that the `min-width` acts as a constraint on the minimum size of the element. If the `calc()` expression results in a smaller width, the `min-width` will take precedence.

```css
div {
  min-width: 200px;
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This revised CSS code correctly applies the `min-width` constraint.  The `min-width` declaration overrides the `calc()` result when necessary.
